Type Casting
Type casting is converting the type of data from one data to another one. 
we have two types of type casting.
1)Explicit/narrowing/manual 
when we go from bigger to smaller data type it is called Explicit/narrowing/manual
2)Implicit/widening/Automatically
when we go from smaller data type to larger data type we call it Implicit/widening/Automatically
Primitive
1) byte(8), 2)short(16), 3)char(16), 4)int (31), 5)long (64) 6) float (32) 6) double (64)
byte->short, char->int->long->float->double Explicit
double->float->long->int, char->short->byte Implicit
Why we need type casting
when we are working in teams we might need to convert data from different data types. when we are working with math some time we 
need to get rid of decimal parts as we are only interested in the non decimal part
what is the syntax?
Explicit/narrowing/Manual
    int box=1000;
     byte box2=(byte) box;
Implicit/widening/Automatic

short box1=250;
int box2=box1;


===========================================================
If statements:

if else condition allow us to write programs that can take decision based on some condition and provided data 
if condition
if else condition
if else if condition
nested if else condition.
why we should learn about if else condition?
when we are solving real life problems
like testing  a web site out program needs to make a lot of decisions.


What is the syntax of if else conditions?
if condition

boolean rich=true;
if (rich)
{
System.out.printIn("Lets buy a Jet or Island");
}
