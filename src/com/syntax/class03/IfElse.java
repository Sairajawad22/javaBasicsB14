		 * what is type casting?
		 * type casting is converting one data type to another data type
		 * why should i learn about type casting?
		 * so that we can use to code that is written by someone else to make life easier
		 * or when we will be working in teams we will be able to  merge the code 
		 * what is the syntax for type casting?
		 * when we are converting somthing smaller to larger we don't need do anything it happens automatically
		 * we just assign the variable for example 
		 * int box = 1234;
		 * 
		 * long box2 = box; // this is how it works and it called implicit or widening or automatic
		 * however when we convert a large data to smaller data types than this how we do it
		 * long box= 1234565;
		 * int box2=(int) box; narrowing or explicit or manual conversion
		 *
